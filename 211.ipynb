Furthermore there is also cool [blog post](https://blog.newrelic.com/engineering/python-programming-styles/) about different programming styles of Python.

This encapsulation prevents unwanted access to our class attributes. `@activity.setter` is a Python class that defines that new value for class attribute will be set. By assigning `pug.activity = \"Pays fetch\"` we are changing `self.__activity` value. `@activity.deleter` is a class that is being called when `del` method is called on a class attribute.

Keeping PEP proposals in mind is a key part of writing clean code. The latest PEP version is PEP8. It covers a style guide for formatting, writing comments, and naming conventions. It also suggests many useful tips on various topics that help developers to improve their code writing skills. Here is a [page](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) which covers all important PEP8 information. For now, you only need to know where to look for information. As a developer, you will be coming back to this page really often. It is really hard to keep all suggestions in mind and even harder not to forget to implement them in your code. Luckily, there are many great tools that help you to use PEP8 ideas in practice."

You should always install one or another to your IDE or Code Editor. This will make your code easy to read and most of the time help you to avoid typos and other silly mistakes.\n",

        "By following PEP8 standards you will help yourself to be as consistent as possible: writing all function names in the same format, naming variables keeping same naming conventions. If all developers follow the same recommendations, they will create code that is unified and easy to understand and interpret. Even writing comments should also be unified. We will talk about commenting in the next lesson of this week but as for now, you should understand that clean comments lead to a clean codebase. You can enforce wanted tools to run at every git commit of code. There is a tool that combines all code styling and formatting tools - [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). Pre-commit runs multiple tools at every git commit and gives an output if the code meets required standards. [Here](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html) you can find the full list of supported hooks to use. You can also add custom ones if needed. The most important idea to take is that it is not complicated to set up linters and code formatters and it rewards you with unified and clean code."
